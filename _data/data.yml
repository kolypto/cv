        link: https://dignio.com/
        tagline: |
            A remote healthcare platform where patients stay at home and take vital signs using wireless devices that transmit them to the back-end application. The application checks whether the measurement is OK, and if not, notifies a nurse.

            The platform also has automatic medication dispensers that serve pre-packaged medication rolls from a pharmacy.

            <p>⚙️Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI, GraphQL (Ariadne), async.

      - title: MongoSQL (open-source library)
        link: https://github.com/kolypto/py-mongosql
        tagline: |
            Provides a query language for the front-end.
            Through this MongoDB-inspired syntax, the front-end can filter, sort, and paginate results through a standardized set of tools — which is a time-saver because the front-end team does not have to wait on the back-end to support these standard features.

      - title: Matroska Cache (open-source library)
        link: https://github.com/kolypto/py-matroska-cache
        tagline: |
            A hierarchical caching solution with dependency tracking. Sounds complicated, but made simple with this library.
